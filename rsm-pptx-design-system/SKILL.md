# RSM PPTX Design System

## Overview

Apply the RSM brand system to presentation work. Refer to the authoritative palette, typography hierarchy, spacing rules, and canonical layouts in the single reference file.

## How to Use

1. Load `references/rsm-design-system.md` for the full specification.
2. Choose a canonical layout that matches the content (cover, section, single column, two columns, bullets, data/chart, highlight).
3. Apply palette, typography hierarchy, and spacing rules exactly as specified.
4. Validate each slide against global rules (one idea per slide, maximum 1 accent color, prioritize contrast and legibility).

If the task includes modifying `.pptx` files, use the `pptx` skill for file mechanics and this skill for brand compliance.

## References

`references/rsm-design-system.md` contains the complete brand specification.

## Assets

Use `assets/rsm-logo.png` for cover and footer placement when a logo is required.
